# Python_Kernel64Patcher
64-bit Kernel patcher that currently supports iOS 11-13 written in Python. This patcher requires only 3 basic dependencies so it's not big nightmare with compiling it like liboffsetfinder64.
# Requirements
Homebrew - https://brew.sh/index_pl
Python3 - brew install python3
argparse - pip install argparse-utils
# Why did I make this?
I made this to have working kernel patcher that I can use on any computer without having problems with compiling.
# Usage
Before using kernel with my tool you need to decompress it with img4lib: ./img4 -i input -o output

Patch iOS 11 kernel - ./Kernel64Patcher.py -i input -o output -a11 AMFI

Patch iOS 12 kernel - ./Kernel64Patcher.py -i input -o output -a12 AMFI

Patch iOS 13 kernel - ./Kernel64Patcher.py -i input -o output -a13 AMFI

# Credits
@L0W_P1X3L , @mcg29_ , @Ralph0045 - for sharing kernel patches in past so I was able to add them automatically to my tool.
